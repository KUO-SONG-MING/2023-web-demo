# WebApi-demo

## This is a Java API practice project using the Spring Boot framework, which contains 4 controller interfaces:

- User: Create an account and log in (with simple validation to check if the account exists).
- ThirdPartyLogIn: Third-party login (using OAuth2 to connect with LINE API for authentication).
- Product: CRUD for products (including a multi-criteria search function).
- Order: Add order data corresponding to the user and order product data corresponding to the product, and retrieve all order data for the user and order product data for each order.
